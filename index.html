      <h1>The Golem Took My Family</h1>
      <p>
        Your family has been kidnapped by the Golem and dragged into his lair in
        the swamp. To free them, you have to first kill the golem with your axe
        [SPACE] and second move the boxes [ARROW KEYS], in which your family is
        being held, to the marked spots on the ground. You can only push the
        boxes, not pull them.
